```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Build & Run (Zero Warnings)
```bash
# Perfect build quality achieved
dotnet build               # ✅ 0 warnings, 0 errors
.\launch-bot.ps1          # Start trading with ML enhancement
```

### 2. Validate ML Integration
```bash
# Comprehensive validation
python3 validate_production_integration.py
# ✅ All 5 tests pass - production ready!
```

### 3. Monitor 24/7 Learning
